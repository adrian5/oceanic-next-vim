## Configuration

### Options

| option                      | value                                             | default                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `g:oceanic_gutter_like_bg`  | **1**: Give gutter same background as file buffer | **0**: Gutter is slightly darker    |
| `g:oceanic_transparent_bg`  | **1**: Make buffer and gutter transparent         | **0**: Use opaque background color  |
| `g:oceanic_bold`            | **0**: Don't use bold text anywhere in theme      | **1**: Make certain text items bold |
| `g:oceanic_italic_comments` | **1**: Comments use italic font (if supported)    | **0**: Comments are not italic      |

Apply any of these before setting the colorscheme, e.g.:

```viml
let g:oceanic_bold = 0
colorscheme oceanicnext
```

### vim-polyglot

If you use [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot), set the following option:

```viml
let g:oceanic_for_polyglot = 1
```

This tweaks syntax highlights for several languages, which can differ considerably from those
shipping with vim.

### lightline

```viml
let g:lightline = { 'colorscheme': 'oceanicnext' }
```

### vim-airline

Should be loaded automatically when setting `oceanicnext` colorscheme.

To keep using the airline *default* theme, set:

```viml
let g:airline_theme = 'default'
```

## What about [mhartington/oceanic-next](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next) ?

The hartington theme offers its own take on the original, and I found the difference sufficient to
warrant another port.

**Update:** In the meantime, the theme has been changed and looks closer to this and the original.
Had I known the author would be open to such revision after years, I would have poured my efforts
into that instead; that's life! :upside_down_face: \
As it stands, my port is quite complete and I intend to keep maintaining and polishing it.

## Contributing

For feedback and requests, please use the Issue tracker.

* For language requests, include code samples (or links thereto) in your report if possible; the
  more syntax I can check against, the better!
* For plugin requests, consider listing features (commands) I should test, e.g. certain lists or
  menus to open.

If you want to submit a PR, please do so **against the** `dev` **branch**! Include a before/after
screenshot if possible, in case I don't have the time to properly vet it. Thanks!
